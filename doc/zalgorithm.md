## Reference:
Code from atcoder library
## Description:
Z_algorithm for string is an array of length n where the i-th element equal to the greatest
number of characters starting from the position i that coincide with the first character of s
## Usage:

* vector<int> ans=z_algorithm(s);

## Constraints:
*0<=n<=10<sup>8</sup><br>
*T is int, uint, ll, or ull

## Time:
* $O(N)$
